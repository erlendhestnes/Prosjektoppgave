\section*{Preface}
%Here, you give a brief introduction to your work. What it is (e.g., a Master's thesis in RAMS at NTNU as part of the study program xxx and\ldots), when it was carried out (e.g., during the autumn semester of 2021). If the project has been carried out for a company, you should mention this and also describe the cooperation with the company. You may also describe how the idea to the project was brought up.\\[2cm]
[this needs some work]

The work presented in this thesis was carried out as a specialization project for the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), in the course Digital System Design (TFE4520). The project was conducted during the autumn semester of 2015.  

The main idea behind the project was contrived in a cooperative effort between the author of this report and Ã˜ystein Moldsvor from the Norwegian company Disruptive Technologies AS.
