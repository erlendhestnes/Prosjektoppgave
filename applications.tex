\chapter{Motion Based IoT Applications}
\label{chap:applications}

The proposed reference board presented in Chapter \ref{chap:reference} is going to be used to showcase different IoT applications that could possibly benefit from utilizing a low power accelerometer. This chapter presents some possibilities with regards to creating such applications. 

\section{Types of measurement}

Consumer grade MEMS accelerometers can typically measure from a range of $\pm2g$ to a range of $\pm16g$, as seen in from the overview in Chapter \ref{chap:overview}. This measurement range is perfectly suited for most use-cases. To put things in perspective, we can look at the acceleration of a few different events (from \cite{g-force}). Light vibrations for instance are in the order of 0.014 - 0.039g's, while the highest recorded earthquake was at its peak 2.99g's. The Bugatti Veyron supercar pulls 1.55g's when doing 0-100km/h in 2.4 seconds, while a F-16 fighter jet is at most able to pull 9g-12g for limited amount of time during a barrel roll. A baseball struck by a baseball bat is on the other hand in the order of 3000g's, which is way above the measurement range for these devices. An acceleration of such magnitude may even in some cases destroy the MEMS element. 

Based on these figures, the most relevant measurement range for an IoT application will be in the range of $\pm2g$ to $\pm4g$. In this range we find both motion and vibration. The former is defined in this thesis as a slow moving event such as the movement of game controller or smart phone, while the latter is defined as oscillations that occur about an equilibrium point. Both motion and vibration can be useful for a vast amount of IoT applications, whereas some of them will be presented in the sections below. 

\subsection{Motion Detection}

Motion detection can in its simplest form be used as a trigger to wake an external system, this solution can for example be a viable substitute for a mechanical on/off switch. For such a configuration we may only care about power consumption, since the collected data is not going to be used for any control input. An example here could be to fuse such a sensor, together with an MCU and temperature sensor, inside a coffee mug. The motion sensor could then detect when the cup was being picked up. Upon such an event it could take a temperature sample and transmit the this data to your phone and perhaps give you a post-drink warning if the beverage was to hot. This example might seem a little frivolous, but it shows some very important benefits of using a low power motion activated trigger. The clear benefit of fusing the system inside the cup is that we can safely have it inside the dishwasher. The downside of fusing the system inside the cup is that it will be impossible to change the battery without breaking the cup. This means that the power consumption needs to be ultra low, so that the battery can last for the entire lifespan of the cup. The cup will probably spend most of its time inside one of the kitchen cupboards doing nothing. It is first when you pick up the cup that you actually would want it to do something interesting, like measuring the temperature of your desired beverage. This could be achieved by incorporating a mechanical on/off switch somewhere on the cup, but this would be harder to make waterproof and would require more effort from the user. A motion activated switch solves both of these problems. 

For an application where control input is a requirement, as well the motion activated trigger functionality, we would be interested in an accelerometer that uses low power in wake-up mode, but are able to sample with precision when it is required. Lets say we wanted to design a self stabilizing coffee cup. This could for instance be very useful for people suffering from Parkinson's disease. A realization of such a product would require more precision from the motion sensor than for the simple temperature example, since the actual data from the motion sensor is going to be used to generate the counter movements to achieve stabilization. However, similar to the temperature example, the cup would only need to enter stabilization mode when it actually was being picked up.

\subsection{Health Monitoring}

Fitness armbands and smart watches is something that has gained much popularity in the recent years. These devices have quite strict requirements when it comes to size, so there is often not much room for a battery. For such applications it is therefore crucial to use ultra low power sensors and efficient data acquisition techniques. However, the sensors also need to have good enough performance to acquire useful data, such as the number of steps taken, heart rate information and so forth.  

Active implants placed inside the body is also something that there has been a substantial amount of research on. These implants can for instance be used to monitor blood sugar levels, heart rhythms or oxygen levels. 

\subsection{Vibration Detection}

For some construction applications it can be very beneficial to be able to monitor the vibrations inside the structure itself. Ultra low power sensors can for instance be submersed inside concrete walls and transmit during the entire life-span of the building. From this application one can really see the problem with changing batteries. As one would literally need to tear down a wall to change them. 

\subsection{Inertial Navigation}

Inertial navigation uses a combination of motion sensors (accelerometers), rotation sensors (gyroscopes) and magnetometers to calculate the current position of a moving object based on a previously determined position. This calculation process is often referred to as dead-reckoning. A typical example is advanced navigation systems for automotive use. Such systems initially uses GPS (Global Positioning System) to determine the cars position. However, during GPS signal loss the system switches over to inertial navigation. The speed of the car as well as the movement from the steering wheel is then used to estimate the cars position based on the previous GPS fix. This makes possible for the GPS system to work inside a tunnel for instance. 

Dead-reckoning is based on path integration and is therefore a subject for cumulative errors, meaning that the system becomes less and less precise over time. Fast integration as well as precision sensors are required to minimize this error. Inertial navigation might not therefore be the best suited application for a low power device.
