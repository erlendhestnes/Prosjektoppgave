\chapter{Possible IoT Applications for Ultra Low Power Accelerometers}

\section{Types of measurement}

Consumer grade MEMS accelerometers can typically measure from a range of $\pm2g$ to a range of $\pm16g$. This range is perfectly suited for measuring motion and vibration. 

This excludes shock and impact detection, as these events typically range in units of several hundred g's.

\subsection{Motion}

In this thesis, a motion is regarded as slow moving event such as the movement of game controller or smart phone.

\section{Potential IoT Application}

This section presents a discussion about possible IoT applications for low power accelerometers. 

\subsection{Vibration Detection}

For some construction applications it can be very beneficial to be able to monitor the vibrations inside the structure itself. Ultra low power sensors can for instance be submersed inside concrete walls and transmit during the entire life-span of the building. From this application one can really see the problem with changing batteries. As one would literally need to tear down the wall to change batteries. 

\subsection{Motion Detection}

Motion Sensing is something that is being widely used in electronic devices today. It is for example being used as control input for certain smart phone applications.

\subsection{Health Monitoring}

Fitness armbands, smart watches is something that has gained much popularity in the recent years. By having an ultra-low power sensor one could see a scenario where one could integrate health monitoring into clothes, shoes and other sports equipment.
