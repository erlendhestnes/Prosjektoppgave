\section{Further Work}

This thesis has provided a lot of useful knowledge about ultra low power accelerometers. From which trade-offs that usually comes with using the lowest power components. For further work, it could be interesting to investigate the possibility of integrating a MEMS based accelerometer together with some of the solutions from Disruptive Technologies AS. More spesifically, to create a ultra low power motion activated trigger.
