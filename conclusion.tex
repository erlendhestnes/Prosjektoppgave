\chapter{Conclusion}

This work has provided a deeper insight into world of MEMS accelerometers. The thesis has explored the limitations with the technology, as well as the benefits. The most low power device has been found, and a custom reference board has been designed for this sensor. Different IoT applications that could benefit from using such a low power sensor has been proposed in Chapter \ref{chap:applications}. 

\section{Further Work}

This thesis has provided a lot of useful knowledge about ultra low power accelerometers. From which trade-offs that usually comes with using the lowest power components. For further work, it would be interesting to implement some of the suggested low power applications from \ref{chap:applications}
