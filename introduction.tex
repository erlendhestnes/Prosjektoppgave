\section{Internet of Things (IoT)}

\textit{The IoT has a total potential economic impact of \$3.9 trillion to \$11.1 trillion a year by 2025. At the top end, that level of value-including the consumer surplus-would be equivalent to about 11 percent of the world economy} \cite{mckinsey15}.

Naturally, a vast amount of semiconductor companies want to be a part of this huge market, and a lot of these companies are therefore increasing their product portfolio to be ready to meet the IoT demand. 

\subsection{What Is IoT}

The Internet of Things (IoT) concerns the continuous expansion of network enabled devices that feature an IP address for Internet connectivity, as well as the communication that exist between them and other Internet-enabled devices and systems \cite{webopedia}. Three very important keywords when it comes to IoT is connectivity, ease-of-use and low-power. For a successful IoT realization, it is necessary to create solutions that are both practical and easy to deploy ubiquitously. This can be achieved by creating both low power and reliable wireless sensor networks \cite{embedded_IoT}. 

\subsection{A Problem with IoT}

It is quite reasonable to assume that you eventually will have more than a hundred IoT devices in your home. Say that each of these devices are using a battery, and that the average battery time for each device is about one or two years. Then you would have a huge job at hand for changing the batteries as they would ultimately run out of power. For the IoT market to be successful and fully appreciated by the customers, one need to be able make devices that does not require the user ever changing the battery. This is certainly a possibility as semiconductor companies continues to push the boundaries for ultra low power components.  

\subsection{Sensors for IoT}

This project thesis focuses on a big part of IoT-applications, namely sensors. A sensor is, in its broadest definition, a device that is both able to detect and respond to some type of input from the physical environment \cite{wigmore12}. They are used in vast number of applications and are considered to be a fundamental building block of the IoT. This thesis targets a specific type of sensor that is used to detect motion, specifically accelerometers. The thesis presents a thorough analysis of five commercially available microelectromechanical (MEMS) 3-axis accelerometers. The analysis focuses primarily on power consumption, but other considerations are also taken into account. From this analysis, an accelerometer is chosen to be used for a reference board. This board will be used in a later report to further explore different IoT applications that could benefit from having an ultra low power accelerometer.

\subsection{Goals and main contributions}

The primary goal for this work has been to identify which ultra low power accelerometers that are available on the market today, as well as to study some of the fundamental principles and limitations behind these products. The insight gained from this exploration has further been used to suggest some possible applications that could benefit from using an ultra low power motion device.
