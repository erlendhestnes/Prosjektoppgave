\textbf{Assignment Title:} 

Sensor Data Acquisition for Ultra-Low Power Applications

\textbf{Assignment Text:}
 
Internet of Things (IoT) applications very often involve use of sensors. Motion sensing can be used in a vast amount of applications and are therefore very interesting in high volume IoT products.
 
Replacing a battery in an IoT application is unwanted, and may in some cases be impossible. It is therefore essential to have sensors that consumes as little power as possible.

\underline{The assignment will be:}

Study different microelectromechanical (MEMS) accelerometers that are commercially available. Find the accelerometer that gives the best trade-off in terms of functionality and power consumption. Design a reference board around this device, and propose a low power data acquisition scheme. Suggest some IoT applications that can benefit from using an ultra-low power accelerometer.
