\textbf{Assignment Title:} 

Sensor Data Acquisition for Ultra-Low Power Applications

\textbf{Assignment Text:}
 
Internet of Things (IoT) applications very often involve use of sensors. Motion sensing can be used in a vast amount of applications and are therefore very interesting in high volume IoT products.
 
Replacing a battery in an IoT application is unwanted, and may in some cases be impossible. It is therefore essential to have sensors that consumes as little power as possible.

The assignment will be:
Design a reference board for an ultra low power accelerometer. Study different approaches for acquiring usable data with the lowest possible power consumption. Demonstrate how this can be used in an IoT application. Possible applications might be:
\begin{itemize}
\item Motion detection
\item Detection of vibrations
\item Impact Force
\end{itemize}
